# ow-scala 
Coding exercise for Oliver Wyman (in scala)

## To build and test

Tested on Linux and OSX using Oracle Java 8

   ```sbt test```          

## Approach

Solution composed of 3 functions found in Exercise

The two support functions are tested in isolation

I largely opted for a generative approach to the testing using scalacheck

Went for recursion although a *local* mutable var and loop would be valid and likely preferred by some
